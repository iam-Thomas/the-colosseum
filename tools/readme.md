## Lua code snippets
Change lua code snippets by adding snippets from lua-snippets.json to vs code lua snippets.

Most code snippets were sourced from here: https://www.hiveworkshop.com/threads/lua-vscode-integration.314974/

But some snippets are specifically for functions made within this project. To use the snippets, do the following:
- Open Visual Studio Code
- Go to extensions and install lua extensions for vscode
- Go to File -> Preferences -> Configure Snippets, and select lua.
- Copy the content from tools/lua-snippets.json to lua.json
