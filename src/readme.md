## Source code

This directory contains the source code for the map. I store the code here in lua files, but ultemately, the code needs to be copied to the code blocks, in the trigger editor, in the world editor.

## Hard coded object references

Note that there are many hard coded object Id reference in the code. These references are map-specific. An object id can be retrieved by navigating to the desired object in the object editor, and pressing Ctrl-D to change the view. The changed view now shows ids where it used to show object names.
